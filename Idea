The underlying principle to be understood here is the control loop process. In an extremely simplified form , control loop is a loop used for setting the output value almost at
a same value throughout for ensuring stability. The components of control loop are 
1) Plant - This is the part of the loop that is being converted or operated upon, the output generated by this plant is what is tried to be put at steady value.Eg-Motor
Temp Sensor,Converter etc.
2) Sensor - This 'senses' the output voltage and generates an electrical signal which is sent to Controller.
3) Controller - Brain of the control loop , the electrical signal recieved from sensor sent to controller which through a control algorithm generates an error signal based on the
difference between the recieved output voltage and a desired setpoint value. This error signal sent to Actuator.
4) Actuator - The error signal is tried to be resolved by applying appropriate correction factors and corrected value sent back to plant for process to be repeated.

In Embedded System Design Process using microcontrollers , it should be understood that control algorithm is implemented through software and not by some analog circuit.

In the case of DC-DC Boost Converter using C2000 TI microcontroller(F28027f)
1) ADC channel of uc connected to O/P voltage of boost converter through voltage divider circuit.
2) PWM O/P pin of uc connected to gate driver circuit of MOSFET in boost converter for switching.

plant here is boost converter and Actuator correction process is varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant regulated O/P voltage.
